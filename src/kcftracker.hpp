/*

Tracker based on Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) [1] and Circulant Structure with Kernels (CSK) [2].
CSK is implemented by using raw gray level features, since it is a single-channel filter.
KCF is implemented by using HOG features (the default), since it extends CSK to multiple channels.

Constructor parameters, all boolean:
    hog: use HOG features (default), otherwise use raw pixels
    fixed_window: fix window size (default), otherwise use ROI size (slower but more accurate)
    multiscale: use multi-scale tracking (default; cannot be used with fixed_window = true)

Default values are set for all properties of the tracker depending on the above choices.
Their values can be customized further before calling init():
    interp_factor: linear interpolation factor for adaptation
    sigma: gaussian kernel bandwidth
    lambda: regularization
    cell_size: HOG cell size
    padding: horizontal area surrounding the target, relative to its size
    output_sigma_factor: bandwidth of gaussian target
    template_size: template size in pixels, 0 to use ROI size
    scale_step: scale step for multi-scale estimation, 1 to disable it
    scale_weight: to downweight detection scores of other scales for added stability

For speed, the value (template_size/cell_size) should be a power of 2 or a product of small prime numbers.

Inputs to init():
   image is the initial frame.
   roi is a cv::Rect with the target positions in the initial frame

Inputs to update():
   image is the current frame.

Outputs of update():
   cv::Rect with target positions for the current frame
